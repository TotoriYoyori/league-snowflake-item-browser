"""Statistical core — pure pandas, no Streamlit and no Snowflake imports.

This is the only module with real logic, so it is deliberately isolated and
unit-testable on a plain DataFrame.

The method, in one line: item win rates are smoothed with empirical-Bayes
shrinkage (a Beta-binomial estimator) toward each champion's pooled win rate,
which stabilises the long tail of low-sample items. Gems and traps are then the
two interesting corners of (adjusted win rate) vs (purchase rate).
