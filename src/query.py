"""Query builders for the Itemization Explorer.

Mirrors the `src/query.py` pattern shared with `pipeline_monitor` and
`role_importance`: each query is a small typed object that knows how to
`.build()` itself into a SQL string. No query is executed here — that is the
sole job of `src/data.py`.

The only non-obvious bit is the `Fiddle Sticks` -> `Fiddlesticks` fix: the item
gold table carries the raw champion name, while the overview table normalises
it. Without the CASE the join silently drops Fiddlesticks.
